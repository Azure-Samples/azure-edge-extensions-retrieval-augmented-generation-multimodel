,Case001  All LEDs are OFF at Control Panel,No LEDs at all are lit on the Control Module or the Drive Module respectively. The system cannot be operated or started at all. The system is not supplied with power. The main transformer is not connected for the correct mains voltage. Circuit breaker F6 (if used) is malfunctioning or open for any other reason. Contactor K41 is malfunctioning or open for any other reason.,prototype01,1. Make sure the main switch has been switched on. 2. Make sure the system is supplied with power. 3. Check the main transformer connection. 4. Make sure circuit breaker F6 (if used) is closed in position 3. 5. Make sure contactor K41 opens and closes when ordered. 6.Disconnect connector X1 from the Drive Module power supply and measure the incoming voltage. 7. If the power supply incoming voltage is correct (230 VAC) but the LEDs still do not work replace the Drive Module power supply.

,Case002 Mechanical noise,A faulty bearing often emits scraping  grinding or clicking noises shortly before failing. Worn bearings. Contaminations have entered the bearing races. Loss of lubrication in bearings. If the noise is emitted from a gearbox the following can also apply: Overheating.,"	prototype02","1. CAUTION! Before approaching the potentially hot component observe the safety information in section CAUTION - Hot parts may cause burns [link]! 2. Determine which bearing is emitting the noise. 3. Make sure the bearing has sufficient lubrication. 4. If possible disassemble the joint and measure the clearance. 5. Bearings inside motors are not to be replaced individually but the complete motor is replaced. 6. Make sure the bearings are fitted correctly. 7. Too hot gearbox oil may be caused by: Oil quality or level used is incorrect. The work cycle runs a specific axis too hard. Investigate whether it is possible to program small """"cooling periods"""" into the application. Overpressure created inside gearbox. Check the recommended oil level and type as specified in the product manual for the machine."

,Case003 Start-up failures,LEDs not lit on any unit. Earth fault protection trips. Unable to load the system software. Machine not responding. Machine starts but does not respond to any input. Disk containing the system software does not start correctly.,prototype03,This may be due to a loss of power supply in many stages. 1. Make sure the main power supply to the system is present and is within the specified limits. 2. Make sure that the main transformer in the Drive module is correctly connected to the mains voltage levels at hand. 3. Make sure that the main switches are switched on. 4. Make sure that the power supply to the Control module and Drive module are within the specified limits.

,Case004 Erratic event messages displayed on the panel,The event messages displayed on the Panel are erratic and do not seem to correspond to any actual malfunctions on the Machine. Several types of messages can be displayed seemingly erroneously. Major operational disturbances due to the constantly appearing messages. Internal manipulator cabling not correctly performed.,service,Causes may be: faulty connection of connectors cable loops too tight causing the cabling to get strained during manipulator movements cable insulation chafed or damaged by rubbing shortcircuiting signals to earth. 1. Inspect all internal manipulator cabling especially all cabling disconnected connected re-routed or bundled during recent repair work. 2. Inspect all cable connectors to make sure these are correctly connected and tightened. 3. Inspect all cable insulation for damage.
